   Explanation for issues of type "TrustAllX509TrustManager":
   This check looks for X509TrustManager implementations whose
   checkServerTrusted or checkClientTrusted methods do nothing (thus trusting
   any certificate chain) which could result in insecure network traffic
   caused by trusting arbitrary TLS/SSL certificates presented by peers.
